        <p>Many children and teenagers today are struggling with mental health and mental disorders. Society has set
            some bad standers for how or what to show, tell or act. These standers are bad and destructive to many
            people struggling with their mental health or with ADHD or autism. This essay will explore the problems with
            societies standards regarding mental health and mental disorders more in depth.</p>

        <p>In today’s day and age, a lot of people are struggling with mental health. Society has set standers of how
            people should be when they feel depressed or empty. People say that men should not show their weak sides
            because “they should look strong” (Bialik, K. Kessel, P. Walker, k. 2018). That will make men afraid of
            showing there week side. Then their emotions will bottle up and lead to them giving up on life or thinking
            that they are worthless, while women can show their emotions, and no one will look down on them for that.
            (Bialik, K. Kessel, P. Walker, k. 2018)

        <p>In the past few years there has been a steady increase in the number of people diagnosed with ADHD and
            autism, according to NIPH. (2019) society has set standers on how ADHD and autism works many people believe
            that ADHD people are active and is hard to keep calm, but it might be the opposite many people with ADHD
            acts differently from one another one may be active, and one might be a complete nerd that likes to sit
            still and look at their pc screen. autism is even more broad than ADHD, there is highly functional autism,
            where all the normal motor functions work as normal, but they think differently then others, and then you
            have low functional autism, highly functional autism is the most common one off all of them they are better
            at keeping schedules and deadlines but if their schedules are disrupted, they struggle.

            The most difficult issue people with mental health and disorders face is that it is hard to find help.
            People with ADHD and autism are struggling with telling people how they feel or think and if they are
            struggling with depression or anxiety, it is even harder to get help from professionals. People seeking
            professional help needs to open to other people, but societies standard has made men afraid of seeking help,
            which is a sign that the standers of society has gotten so bad for men that they will rather suffer in
            silence then talk to anyone (Harper, C. 2023).

            In conclusion there are many factors that contribute to mental health issues with the young people then the
            older generation. Sins they grew up in a time without internet or limited access to it, they do not know how
            much the society has pushed mental health issues under the rug for men. In the past few years mental health
            and mental disorders have steadily increased for both genders. Society focuses more on mental disorders then
            mental health, the best course of action would be to focus equally on mental health and disorders.
